# Customer_Personality_Analysis
## Power BI Project
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a companyâ€™s ideal customers. It helps a business to understand its customers better. It makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of customers.
I made the modeling and created interactive dashboards using Power BI to communicate and deliver insights and give recommendations.
